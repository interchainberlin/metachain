# Diff

This page tries to capture the difference between the existing
[Gov](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.42.4/x/gov/spec) module and
this DAO one.

Note that there is a considerable change in what the DAO module tries to achieve
from the outset. Gov may be considered the governance of the entire chain as a
whole only whereas DAO represents the toolkit for groups to govern one another
where one group most likely represents the chain as a whole (the staking group).
